                        Singapore Polytechnic was set up on 27 October 1954, making it the very first polytechnic to be established in Singapore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Singapore Polytechnic started out right in the heart of the financial district. 
                        Today, the polytechnic is located strategically in Dover Road - in the educational belt and science hub in the western part of Singapore. 
                        Our graduates have contributed significantly to Singapore's economic and industrial growth and many are now well-known entrepreneurs. 
                        Others hold positions of responsibility and leadership in industry, business and in public organisations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may be the oldest Polytechnic but the pioneering spirit is kept very much alive. 
                        Look around our campus. 
                        We are constantly refurbishing the buildings and facilities to ensure that they are up to date and well equipped for training students in the new industries and emerging technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The change and development is not limited to the physical. Our underlying philosophy and leadership provide the direction for our vision.

                    Joining hands with the Public Hygiene Council (PHC) on SG Clean Day, 1000 SP students took part in an epic clean-up event at F1 Pit Building on 13th May 2023! 
                    Together, we shattered records for the largest island-wide clean-up effort in the Singapore Book of Records, but it shouldn't stop there! 
                    It's time to ignite conversations about caring for our living spaces and inspire a new wave of compassionate youth to step up as champions for a cleaner, more sustainable future. 
                    Let's keep the momentum going!
