                    <p id="intro"> Hey! My name's <em>Goh Pin Pin Isaac</em> aka <b>PinPin.</b>  
                        As strange my name seems, I was born in <dfn title="Kandang Kerbau Hospital">KK Hospital</dfn> and raised in Singapore.
                         Both my parents are singaporeans with my mother being <dfn title="Dialect relating to Canton (Guangzhou)">Cantonese</dfn>, while my dad being

                    <p>
                        I’ve been in the ACS Family for the past 10 years. ACS(Primary) and ACS(Barker Road) was an exciting chapter in my life. 
                        Our brotherhood formed in the years is something that can’t be replaced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got interested in tech since young and it all started from the Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelReeves" target="_blank">Micheal Reeves</a>. 
                        Which inspired me to take O'level Computing and create basic programs like solving simultaneous equations using matrix and decyphering a string using the digits of pi.
                        During the June holidays of 2022, My computing teacher encouraged me to take part in the <b>Youth Cyber Exploration Program (YCEP)</b> compertition hosted by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sp.soc/" target="_blank">SOCA</a>. 
                        Which gave a good impression of Soc and made me aim for SP ICT courses. 
                        After O'levels, I ended up choosing this school as first choice and as my new chapter in life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the next 3 years, i'll be studying in Singapore Polytechnic. 
                        My courses is DCITP common ict and in the second semester, i plan on changing into DAAA as AI is a really relevant and important topic is our day and age and data is always important for us.
                        After graduating from Singapore Poly, I will serve my country and apply to a local university for a degree in COMPUTER SCIENCE and go into the workforce competent enough to make changes in our digital world.

                    <p>
                        Being honest means telling the truth, even though it is difficult or uncomfortable. 
                        It also means admitting mistakes, taking responsibility for one's actions, and avoiding deception and fraud. 
                        Honesty entails being open and transparent with others, and not hiding important information or keeping secrets even if it could harm others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Honesty is a critical value that contributes to the well-being of individuals, communities, and society as a whole. 
                        By embracing honesty as a core value, people can build strong relationships, foster trust and cooperation, and promote fairness and justice.

                        Being responsible means fulfilling one's obligations and commitments, be it work, family, and community related responsibilities. 
                        It means taking care of one's own physical, emotional, and mental well-being, as well as that of others around them. 
                        It also involves making informed decisions, based on sound reasoning and evidence, and considering the potential outcomes and consequences of those decisions.

                    <h3>Sustainable Fashion</h3>
                    <p>
                        My older sister is a cosplayer and I help her make some of the cosplay items.
                        Cosplaying is very expensive because it requires many different parts and layers along with the skills to put everything together.
    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, I use recycled materials to create the cosplay outfit.
                        The most common materials used to make props for cosplay are EVA foam, paper clay, PVC pipes, and Worbla. 
                        (Which are found at most blue recycling bins)
                        I combine cardboard, wood, wire, fabric, and many more supplies to create accessories for my sister's character.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey started off making Valorant Knifes using cardboard paper from the back of writing paper.
                        Each knifes took 1 day of time and sore fingers to make but the more effort I put into it, the more engaged I was.
                        The gun was my next project which I did at the end of O'levels for my friend as a reward for completing Olevels.
                        It took me 3 whole day of working on it but it was still very satisfying when I saw the end result
                        The Katana was my Biggest Project yet.
                        It took me 2 days of planning and sketching and a week of cutting it out. I even had my sister help me cut out the pieces.
    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I have none of my projects with me as I gave all my cosplay items away as a symbol that happiness isn't in the result but in the effort put into it and the people who receives it.
                        I know that my items will always be in good hands.
